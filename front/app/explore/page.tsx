                    E-waste is any electronic device that is no longer used or
                    wanted. It can be working or broken, and it can be thrown
                    away or donated. If it is donated and goes unsold, it is
                    likely to be thrown away. E-waste is dangerous because it

                      contains toxic chemicals{" "}

                    that can leak out of the metals when it is buried or thrown
                    improperly. While above ground, modern electronics are safe
                    to use and be around. However, most electronics contain some
                    form of toxic materials, including beryllium, cadmium,
                    mercury, and lead, which pose serious environmental risks to
                    our soil, water, air, and wildlife.

                    According to the World Health Organization (WHO), health
                    risks may result from direct contact with toxic materials
                    that leach from e-waste. These include minerals such as
                    lead, cadmium, chromium, brominated flame retardants, or
                    polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Danger can come from
                    inhalation of toxic fumes, as well as from the accumulation
                    of chemicals in soil, water, and food. This puts not just
                    people in danger but land and sea animals as well. E-waste
                    can affect humans in a number of ways. Exposure to the
                    harmful substances in e-waste can cause a variety of health

                      be responsible for the collection and recycling of their
                      products at the end of their life cycle. The rules also
                      establish a framework for the collection, transportation,
